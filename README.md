# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
cd digital-marketplace
npx hardhat node
```
Open another terminal
```shell
cd digital-marketplace
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Copy paste the addresses in config.js

```shell
npm run dev
```
